<p><strong>Season Link<sup>TM</sup> Privacy Policy </strong></p>
<p>Shoptology, Inc. and New Lion Media Group, LLC (“Season Link<sup>TM</sup>”, “we” or “us”) respects the privacy of its Season Link<sup>TM</sup> users (“users”, “you” or “your”) and has created this Privacy Policy in order to describe our commitment to your privacy, as well as inform you of our information collection, use, storing, sharing and protection of your personal information from or related to the Season Link<sup>TM</sup> services and tools available on the application and website (http://seasonlink.co), (collectively, the “Service”) operated by us, regardless of how you access or use the Service.</p>
<p>By using the Season Link<sup>TM</sup> Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and consent to the processing of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE THE SERVICE.</p>
<p>Please refer to Season Link<sup>TM</sup>'s Terms of Service and End User License Agreement to understand the terms of your access and use of the Service (http://seasonlink.co/terms).</p>
<p><strong>Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>Throughout this Privacy Policy, we use the term &quot;Personally Identifiable Information&quot; to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. In order to provide you with our team and group management Service, we will ask you to provide us with some Personally Identifiable Information. We only collect such Personally Identifiable Information that you voluntarily provide to us. Personally Identifiable Information for an individual user, would, in most cases include your name, your email address, a password, and your age (to verify that you are 13 or older – see Protection for Children below).</p>
<p>We do not consider Personally Identifiable Information to include information that has been made anonymous or aggregated so that it can no longer be used, whether in combination with other information or otherwise, to identify a specific person. We may collect other information that does not reveal Personally Identifiable Information about you, such as IP host address, pages viewed, statistics, browser type, traffic to and from the Service, standard web log information and other data.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of Information that You or Your Team May Provide</strong></p>
<p>The following Personally Identifiable Information may be collected about you or your team.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your contact information (for example, phone number, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Sport specific information (for example, team sport, position, statistics, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Schedule information (for example, whether you plan to attend an upcoming event)</p></li>
<li><p>Location information (for example, your physical location at a given time). We will always ask you for your permission before we obtain your location information.</p></li>
<li><p>Device and software identifiers and/or information (for example, the type of mobile device and associated hardware and software information, the browser used to access our web service, etc.). On mobile devices, these are only collected by us if you elect to allow push notifications. You may use the Service without push notifications.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Protection for Children</strong></p>
<p>The Service is not for use by children under the age of 13. Season Link<sup>TM</sup> will never knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from, or communicate directly with, children under the age of 13. When we become aware that Personally Identifiable Information from a child under the age of 13 has been collected without the child’s parent or guardian’s consent, we will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.</p>
<p>When the Service is used by teams or groups with children under the age of 13, the parents or guardians of the children are responsible for entering and managing their children’s information or authorizing others to do so. You should not submit information about children under the age of 13 unless you are the parent or guardian of that child or have the permission of the parent or guardian. If you are the parent / guardian of a player whose team is using Season Link<sup>TM</sup>, we may ask you for optional information about your child (e.g., player name, position, gender, sports statistics).  You will not be asked to provide more information than is necessary to enable you to participate in the activities of the website on your child’s behalf. At any time you may review the information provided about your child and ask that it be removed.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Cookies and Image Tags</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are small amounts of information stored in files within your computer's browser. We may use session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to store your preferences, identify you and maintain your signed-in status, and provide you with a more personal and interactive experience.</p>
<p>We do not store your username, password or your Personally Identifiable Information in a cookie.</p>
<p>We offer certain features that are available only through the use of cookies. You are always free to decline cookies if your web browser permits. However, if you decline cookies, you may not be able to use certain Season Link<sup>TM</sup> features. Your web browser may enable you to indicate your preference as to whether you wish to allow websites to collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services.</p>
<p>We may use web beacons which are typically small graphic objects or pixels that are embedded in a web page. We may also use various analytic tools to measure how users interact with our website and content. As users navigate between various web pages, analytic tools provide us with tags to record information about the page the user has seen or done on previous pages / interactions with the Service. In addition, other parties may collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different Web sites when you use the Service. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, those other parties. Please see the sections of this Privacy Policy entitled “Sharing Your Information” and “Third Parties” for more detail on how we interact with third parties with respect to your information.</p>
<p><strong>Information Usage</strong></p>
<p>Unless disclosed otherwise, we use your information, including Personally Identifiable Information, solely to provide the Service. We have little to no interest to look at your Personally Identifiable Information, but, during the process of developing and troubleshooting the Season Link<sup>TM</sup> Service, it may be necessary to look at pieces of your Personally Identifiable Information to improve the Service or resolve a problem or dispute.</p>
<p>Unless disclosed otherwise, we do not share any Personally Identifiable Information you submit with any unaffiliated third party, unless it is necessary to respond to your inquiry or to comply with applicable law.</p>
<p>If you request support, we may look at your Personally Identifiable Information in order to assist you. We may also access and use your Personally Identifiable Information to compare information for accuracy and verify it with affiliated third parties or to comply with applicable law, legal process or legal requirements imposed by courts or administrative agencies. We may use your Personally Identifiable Information to inform you about new services and updates.</p>
<p>We may use information you submit in the aggregate – which means that the shared information will not contain or be linked to any Personally Identifiable Information - to improve and enhance your experience on the Service; to customize, measure and further develop our Service; and/or to use for our research or improvement activities. We may also access information from third-parties that provide analytical data.  We use that information to improve the effectiveness of Season Link<sup>TM</sup> and make the service easier to use.  We analyze the data in the aggregate, rolling up the data across many users to better understand how Season Link<sup>TM</sup> is being used at a macro level. </p>
<p>We may access non-personal information from third parties to improve the Season Link<sup>TM</sup> Service, but we will always ask for your permission before doing so. For example, with your permission, we may access information about your location, determined from your IP address or mobile device location information, to personalize your experience. We may use this information to provide you with weather or other information that pertains to your location and/or event.</p>
<p>No one at Season Link<sup>TM</sup> has access to your payment card information. All payment card information is handled by highly-secure third parties. Season Link<sup>TM</sup> does not store payment details in its databases. We store your information that we collect on servers located in, and process your Personally Identifiable Information in, the United States.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to access and/or disclose Personally Identifiable Information we gather to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulations, the Terms of Service, the rights of third parties, or to investigate any suspected conduct which we deem improper.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Your Information</strong></p>
<p>Season Link<sup>TM</sup> will not sell, rent or lease your Personally Identifiable Information to others except as described in this policy. Season Link<sup>TM</sup> shares Personal Identifiable Information in the following ways:</p>
<p>Season Link<sup>TM</sup> may employ or engage various third-parties to run various components of the Service, as further described below.  Season Link<sup>TM</sup> relies upon such third parties to maintain the safety and security of your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
<p>We may transfer any such information to a successor in business (for example, in connection with a sale or merger) or the purchasers of a division or line of Season Link<sup>TM</sup>’s business responsible for the functionality of the Service. If we are involved in a business transfer, your Personally Identifiable Information may be transferred, but we will require the surviving or successor company to initially abide by this policy with respect to your Personally Identifiable Information and you will receive prior notice if your Personal Identifiable Information will be used contrary to this policy following the transaction. You can, at any time, opt-out of the Service. Please see the section of this Privacy Policy entitled “Opt-Out Process” for more information.</p>
<p>We may use third-party service providers to help measure our content and advertising effectiveness and to serve ads on our behalf and on behalf of other third-parties. These ads are shown across the Internet and sometimes on Season Link<sup>TM</sup>. We may share some anonymous, aggregated demographic information with some of these service providers, but we do not share any Personally Identifiable Information except as specified in this Privacy Policy.  These third party service providers may place cookies or web beacons on our websites, but we do not permit them to collect Personally Identifiable Information (for example, email, phone, etc.) in this process.</p>
<p><strong>Managing Your Information</strong></p>
<p>If you are a registered user of the Service, you may review, update, correct or delete your Personally Identifiable Information by accessing the settings page of the Season Link<sup>TM</sup> app. If you have concerns or need assistance, please contact us at info@seasonlink.co</p>
<p>Photos, team schedules and other information may be maintained by the team or school representative.  If you have concerns about such information, please contact your team or school representative or contact Season Link<sup>TM</sup> at info@seasonlink.co.</p>
<p>We may communicate with you at various times, with administrative emails or phone calls, about transactions and service announcements, customer service responses and/or promotional emails like special offers, newsletters and updates. You can choose to stop receiving such by changing your preferences, unsubscribing, or using an email's unsubscribe function. You may not opt-out of receiving administrative messages or customer service responses. If you have agreed to receive marketing communications through interactions with our partners, and should you wish to stop receiving such, you must change your communication preferences with the applicable partner directly.</p>
<p>If you choose to invite others to use Season Link<sup>TM</sup>, we may ask you for your friend's email and possibly their name. We will automatically send your friend a copy of the email. Season Link<sup>TM</sup> or our service providers store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. Your friend may contact us at info@seasonlink.co to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<p><strong>Security and Retention</strong></p>
<p>The security of your Personally Identifiable Information is very important to us. We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. The information we collect is stored on our servers located in the United States. Season Link<sup>TM</sup> uses Secure Sockets Layers (SSL) to secure the transmission of data between our servers and your browser. SSL is an encryption technology that provides secure communications over the Internet. It does this by verifying that the server to which you are connected is actually the one it claims to be. It also encrypts all transactions between the parties communicating. Encryption is the scrambling of information as it is transmitted over the Internet to protect your confidentiality. Personal and payment card information passing between your computer and Season Link<sup>TM</sup>’s services is encrypted. In other words, while your information is in transit, it is scrambled so that only Season Link<sup>TM</sup> and the service providers we engage to run the Service can reassemble it in its original text format. Season Link<sup>TM</sup> uses the SSL protocol when secure communication with you is necessary.</p>
<p>No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Please be aware that the possibility exists that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or Personally Identifiable Information. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your Personally Identifiable Information or other information. As such, by using the Service, you acknowledge that the potential for unauthorized access exists, and that you have agreed to assume this risk.</p>
<p>We retain information as long as it is necessary and relevant for our operations. In addition, we may retain Personally Identifiable Information from closed accounts to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce our Terms of Service and take other actions permitted by law.</p>
<p><strong>Third Parties</strong></p>
<p>The Season Link<sup>TM</sup> Service may integrate with or contain links to other websites and services. For example, you may be able to order team or group themed merchandise through one of our partners. An integrated third party service or sites has their own privacy statements and terms of conditions that we do not control. We encourage you to review these statements and terms and contact the third party with any questions. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or other actions of these third parties.</p>
<p><strong>California Privacy Rights</strong></p>
<p>That State of California allows users who have provided personal information to Season Link<sup>TM</sup> to request information about disclosures of personal information to certain types of third parties (California Civil Code Section 1798.83). To request that information, please contact us at info@seasonlink.co.</p>
<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions to or from this Privacy Policy at any time. In the event of such, we will post the changes on this site and provide you the opportunity to opt-out of such different uses. If there is a material change to the Season Link<sup>TM</sup> Privacy Policy for any reason, unless you have opted out of email communications from Season Link<sup>TM</sup>, we will notify you promptly by sending an email to an email address we have on file for you. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to this Privacy Policy means you accept such changes.</p>
<p><strong>Opt-Out Process</strong></p>
